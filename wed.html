<h1> Flowers</h1>
<p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae).<br> The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.<br> Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.

There are two types of pollination: self-pollination and cross-pollination. <br>Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant.<br> Cross-pollination is when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.<br> Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma.<br> This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[1]
